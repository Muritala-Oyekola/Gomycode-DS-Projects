Unlike these languages, Python does not require explicit variable declarations; instead, it relies on assignment statements.\n","\n","## Static Typing vs. Dynamic Typing\n","\n","In statically typed languages like C, C++, or Java, when you declare a variable, you set aside a specific area of memory for holding values of a predefined data type. This memory allocation is interpreted strictly according to the data type of the variable. For example, if you declare an integer variable, the allocated memory will be treated as an integer, and attempting to store any other data type in it will result in a compile-time error. This rigid type checking ensures that variables are used consistently with their declared types.\n","\n","## Dynamic Typing in Python\n","\n","Python, on the other hand, is dynamically typed. In Python, there is no need to explicitly declare a variable's data type. Instead, Python stores values at specific memory locations and binds variable names to these memory containers. It doesn't determine the variable's type until the code is executed at runtime.\n","\n","This dynamic typing approach has several implications:\n","\n","1. No Explicit Declaration: In Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable before assigning a value to it. You can simply assign a value, and Python will infer the variable's type based on the assigned value.\n","\n","2. Type Flexibility: Python variables can change their type during execution. For example, you can assign an integer value to a variable and later reassign it to hold a string, and Python will adapt to these changes without any compile-time errors.\n","\n","3. Run-Time Type Checking: Python checks variable types at runtime, not at compile time. It allows you to mix different data types in your code, and any type-related errors will only be discovered when the code is executed."],"metadata":{"id":"Dzg9LO34Jz7U"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Dynamic typing in action\n","x = 42      # x is an integer\n","x = \"Hello\" # x is now a string\n","x = 'Emmanuel'\n","\n","# No compile-time errors, as Python adapts to the changing type of x\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pkvgK7yAKRfO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"xYuh6wMl8YNN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709026965089,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":527,"user":{"displayName":"Shaibu Samuel","userId":"00137510565449629835"}},"outputId":"565bb28f-2a4f-47ac-eafa-47517e1cf5ea"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Emmanuel'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In summary, Python's dynamic typing simplifies variable assignment and allows for greater flexibility in handling data types, as it determines variable types at runtime rather than compile time.
